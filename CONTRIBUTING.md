2. **Edits/PRs:** Fork → branch → edit markdown → open Pull Request.

## Workflow

## Content Standards
- Evidence-informed; plain-language; culturally responsive; accessible.
- Education-first (no treatment directives). Use “modeled” assessment language.
- Use inclusive terms; avoid ableist/pathologizing phrasing.

## Technical Standards
- Markdown (`.md`), 80–100 char line wrap recommended.
- Headings: `#`, `##`, `###`…; use lists and tables sparingly.
- Filenames: `kebab_or_snake_case.md`; keep within the predefined folders.
